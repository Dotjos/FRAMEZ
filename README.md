# FRAMEZ

A modern mobile application built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native.

## 📱 About

FRAMEZ is a cross-platform mobile application created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app), providing a seamless experience across iOS, Android, and web platforms.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn
- iOS Simulator (for macOS users)
- Android Studio and Android Emulator (optional)
- Expo Go app (optional, for quick testing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dotjos/FRAMEZ.git
cd FRAMEZ
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the App

Start the development server:

```bash
npx expo start
```

Once the development server is running, you have several options to view your app:

- **Development Build**: Open in a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- **Android Emulator**: Run on [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- **iOS Simulator**: Run on [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) (macOS only)
- **Expo Go**: Use [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) for quick testing (limited sandbox environment)

## 📂 Project Structure

This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/). Start developing by editing the files inside the `app` directory.

## 🔄 Reset Project

When you're ready to start with a clean slate:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will:

- Move the starter code to the `app-example` directory
- Create a blank `app` directory for your development
